Exercism helps learning a new Language through exercises. The interesting fact is that it has mentors on the platform giving feedback on solutions.

Rust is a ~~systems level~~ general purpose programming language (I feel) helping engineers, coders, hobbyists write efficient software.

To know more about this fantastic language check this [stackoverflow-blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/)


This repo consists of my solutions to such exercises and refactored to be idiomatic as per the mentors suggestions.
